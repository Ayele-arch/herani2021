      The Gedeo of southern Ethiopia have an indigenous system of governance called Baalle. The
      Baalle and the Gaada system of the Oromo have some similarities. For example, both have
      grading system and exercise periodic transfer of power (i.e., every eight years). The role of
      religion is high in the two indigenous systems of governance. Moreover, the customary law
      of the Gedeo is called Seera. The Ya’a, the general assembly, is the highest body of the
      Gedeo indigenous system of governance. The Baalle is a complex system which has three
      administrative hierarchies: Abba Gada, Roga (traditional leader next the Abba Gada), and
      two levels of council of elders known as Hulla Hayyicha and Songo Hayyicha. The Abba Gada
      is the leader of the Baalle. The Baalle system has a body of laws called Seera. Conflicts are
      resolved by the Songo hayyicha at village level. When disputes are not settled at the village
      level, cases can be referred to first to the Hulla Hayyicha and finally to the Abba Gada. In
      general, the Gedeo system of governance has the following major institutions: the ya’a
      (general assembly), the Seera (customary law), the Abba Gada, and council of elders.
