  The Gamo are among Omotic peoples of southern Ethiopia. Unlike their neighboring people
  such as Wolayta and Dawro, the Gamo did not have a centralized political system. The
  Gamo people were organized into several local administrations locally known as deres.
  According to anthropological findings, there were more than 40 deres across the Gamo
  highlands. Each dere had its own ka’o (king) and halaqa (elected leader). The indigenous
  system of governance embraces the dere woga (customary law) and the dubusha
  assemblies. The highest body of the indigenous governance is the dere dubusha, a general
  assembly that is responsible to make and revise customary laws, resolve major disputes that
  cannot be solved at the lower levels. The dubushas assembly has three hierarchies: 1) the
  dere dubusha (at the top), sub-dere dubusha (at the middle), and guta/neighborhood
  dubusha (at the village level). Minor cases and disputes are resolved by the dere cima,
  council of elders. Like the Oromo Gada and the Gedeo Baalle, the indigenous governance of
  the Gamo is embedded in the Gamo belief system. It is believed that telling a lie and hiding
  the truth are considered as violation of taboo, which would lead to spiritual pollution and
  then misfortunes including lack of fertility, illness, and death of human beings and livestock.
  Gorden asera (Soddo Gurage), Senago sera (Mesqan Gurage), and Seera
  (Gedeo).
