      The Gaada of the Oromo is one of the well-studies indigenous systems of governance.
      Scholars have been studying the Oromo Gaada since the 1950s. Scholars studied the Oromo
      Gaada include Paul Baxter, Eike Haberland and Asmerom Legesse. Asmerom, a famous
      anthropologist, is widely known for his ethnographic studies on the Oromo political system.
      He published a lot on the Gaada system, particularly focusing on the Borena Oromo. The
      following are two of his books: Gadaa: Three Approaches to the Study of African Society,
      published in 1973; and Oromo Democracy: An Indigenous Political System, printed in 2000.
      The Gadaa system is ‘an age grading institution of the Oromo that has a complex system of
      administration, law making and dispute settlement’ (Pankhurst and Getachew 2008, xiv).
      The Gadaa is a highly celebrated institution of governance and dispute settlement among
      the Oromo people. Gadaa is widely mentioned as an egalitarian (democratic) system of
      governance. In the Gadaa system, political power is transferred from one generation set
      (Luuba) to another every eight years. Gaada officials such as the Abba Gaada and Abba
      Seera(father of law) serve for eight years and leave their position to the new generation of
      Gadaa officials.
      The Gaada system involves a continuous process of law making and revision. The law
      making process has rooms for wider participation of the people. Gumi gaayo, a law making 
      118
      assembly of the Borana Oromo, is a good example. Gumi gaayo is held every eight years to
      revising, adapting, making and publicizing the customary law (seera) and custom (aadaa) of
      the Oromo. The Waliso Oromo have a law making assembly known as yaa’iiharaa, an
      equivalent of gumigaayo, held every eight years. The Gaada is an indigenous system of
      governance, conflict resolution, and peacemaking. The indigenous system of governance
      among the Oromo also include institutions of conflict resolution such as the Jaarsa Biyyaa
      (literally: elders of the soil/land) institution.
